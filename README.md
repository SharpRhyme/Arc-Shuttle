Arc shuttle (or arc for short) is for me to join my hobby of badminton with programming, to do this I will create a scoring system, scheduler for matches as well as eventually a ranking system. 

The scoring system will operate as follows:
- user will input singles/doubles, names of players and a predefined final score/prescense of deuce
- the system will save scores permanently for the future ranking system.
- there will be a live score input option for referees to also track who serves

#why this matters?
the current popular format of ebadders is not open source, and utilises ranking against other players, or letters to define individual rank

Instead I plan to utilise an optional leaderboard system, with more focus on a players individual score (0-100). I also hope this will allow me to create a fairer algorithm allowing players to easily join other clubs and get an accurate ranking earlier.

By talking to my badminton coach I identified that the current main platform ebadders prefers mixed ability balanced matches, leaving higher level players wishing for more competitive matches. This is something I intend to change in my program.

Furthermore my recreational club organiser brought up some points:
    The program should take into account point difference of win, rather than just win or lose on a players ranking

    Results should be editable post match for up to 24 hours in case of incorrect input 

    Possibly some way to rank male and female players together rather than just seperately

    Ensure all players can play an equal number of matches to the best point possible.

    Give more data such as which partner a certain player plays best with (or worst).
